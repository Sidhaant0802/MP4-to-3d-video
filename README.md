# Materials Needed
Red and Cyan Transparent Plastic Sheets:

You can buy colored cellophane, acetate sheets, or use transparent plastic wrap colored with markers.
Red filter for the left eye.
Cyan (or blue-green) filter for the right eye.
Cardboard or Sturdy Paper:

Use something durable, like a cereal box, or even buy a printable 3D glasses template online.
Scissors, Glue, or Tape:

For cutting the lenses to size and securing them to the cardboard frame.
# Steps to Make the 3D Glasses
Prepare the Frame:

Cut out the shape of the glasses frame from cardboard, including two holes for the "lenses." Alternatively, search for free templates online that you can print and cut out.
Attach the Filters:

Cut the red and cyan plastic sheets to fit the lens holes.
Attach the red filter over the left eye hole and the cyan filter over the right eye hole.
Use glue or tape to secure them in place.
Wear and Test:

Try on the glasses and watch the video! The red-cyan filter effect should work with the anaglyph 3D video created by your program, giving you a sense of depth when viewing.
# Optional: Printable Templates
You can find printable 3D glasses templates online. Look for "DIY 3D glasses template" or "printable 3D glasses template" for options you can print, cut out, and use as a base for your DIY 3D glasses.

# Important Notes
Lighting: Anaglyph 3D works best in dim lighting, as too much ambient light can reduce the 3D effect.
Color Matching: For best results, ensure the red and cyan sheets you use are true to their colors, as close as possible to the shades of typical 3D glasses.
